In this case, I defined positive to mean the reviewer assigned a score of 5 stars, and I defined negative to be any score of less than 5 stars. Since about 60% of the reviews were 5-star reviews, I took this to mean reviewers were usually quite willing to give 5 star reviews, and a score of less than 5 stars indicates some sort of unhappiness on the part of the reviewer. Thus, 5 stars is a positive review, and less than 5 stars is a negative review."
